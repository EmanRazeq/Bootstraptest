        <p><i>Today we have the Space Gray Macbook and the Macbook Pro models to a new Era.</i> Some features include 16GB unified memory, 512GB SSD storage
      a 14-inch liquid Retina display, a Backlit Magic Keyboard with a touch ID. The Macbook Pro was released on June 2017. It also has "Hey Siri" support and 
      the price range starts at $1,299 for a 13 inch, and $2,399 for a 15 inch. The Macbook comes in the colors Space Gray or Silver. The Macbook Air was released
      on November 7, 2018. Some key features include Apple T2 Security chips and a more portable design and an all-day battery life. We can see that Apple has really
      developed into an even more amazing computer with better qualities and better features. The quality of paint is 100 times better then the past Macbooks. It does
      not peel off and the paint is better. It weighs 2.75 pounds, has up to 1.5TB of storage which is one of the biggest chnages that Apple has developed. The storage 
      improvemnet is crazy as with the iBook and the G4 Era they didn't have as much storage and the qualities were still off but now Steve Jobs has come along way and 
      improved like crazy. The demand for these beautiful computers are everyones to go technology whether its for work or school and etc. I have a Macbook Pro today 
      and it works amazing. The sound quality is much better and the screen is huge. The touchbar keyboard is very smooth and its fast and easy to work with.
