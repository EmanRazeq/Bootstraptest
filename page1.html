        <p>Macbooks changed the world forever when they first started adapting. <i>One classic Macs had started developing
          was the original Macintosh that was released in 1984</i>. The Powerbook 100 was Apples first ever laptop that 
          had a keyboard that made your palms rest on a trackball, but the disk drive wasn't that great. The price of 
          this was $2,500. It had 2 to 8 megabytes of memory. a 9-inch monochrome liquid crystal display, with 
          a 640 x 400 pixel resolution, and was known for its unique compact design of the trackball pointing device. It 
          was very popular at the time and John Sculley who was the one that started the Powerbook and had made $1 million 
          for marketing, leaving a sucess behind the Powerbook. Since the first Powerbook was a success, Sculley decided 
          to continue with this product design but instead he extended the way it looks by adding different features
          making it even more popular and making $25 million used for marketing. Even though this was a success, Apple 
          decided that they wanted help from the Company "Sony" because Apple did not have enough engineers to produce 
          the number of successful products that people were buying. Sony had very little experience in trying to 
          build these personalized computers, but after 13 months of giving the Powerbook 100 their top priority, it 
          became the main focus in 1992. The battery lasted about 2 1/2-3 hours long and Apple's purpose in designing it 
          the way they did was because they wanted to make it a more personal accessory as if you are carrying a wallet 
          or briefcase with you.
