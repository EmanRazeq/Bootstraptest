        <p><i>The PowerBook G3 was announced and released on May 16, 1994</i>. Some key features include a 14.1 inch screen, CD-ROM and DVD-ROM drives built
          in video output, and expansion bays. The price of this was $1,999. It was two times faster then the Pentium processors used in Pc desktops.
          It also had a flip up keyboard for better access to the RAM expansion slot. There was also the iBook G3 which was known as the "clamshell."
          It was released on June 21,1999. Some key features include a wireless networking PowerPc processor, and a 6 hour ion battery. The price of 
          this was $1,599. It had two translucent colors in a 12.1 inch matrix display and a 3.2GB hard disk drive. Another cool feature about this was
          that it had a sleep indicator beacon light that showed if your iBook was asleep or if it was turned off. Some issues with this were the quality 
          of the display which had a habit of breaking a lot since they used glue to put the pieces of the display together. This was the first time that
          they had introduced the white Apple Logo on the back of the computer. According to some people, the iBook looked like a toliet seat. Steve Jobs
          was the owner of Apple at the time and he returned to Apple with crazy new computers that were high in demand. Consumers were buying the iBook 
          and it was a more successful toll then the other classic macbooks. They were cool looking and anyone who had one was considered to have money.
