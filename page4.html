        <p><i>The G4 Era also known for the silver laptops is the era where it all started</i>. It was announced on January 9, 2001, and released in January 2001. Some 
          key features include the PowerPC G4 processor, a titanium metal body, had a 5 hour battery life, a 1 inch thick and weighed 5.3 pounds, the titanium was 
          light and the the paint easily got off the metal so Apple still was having difficulties trying to better their quality of the Macbook but each time they 
          came out with a new computer, the quality would somewhat become better. Apple made this laptop with anodized aluminum and still continue to use it in 
          today's models. It also had an adjustable arm base and had a screen that can be moved which was considered to be one of the coolest computers in that time 
          frame. Some more features include a Superdrive that everyone could afford so people were beginning to buy this affordable laptop! Apple started off with the 
          size 13 inch and later released a 17 and 20 inch display screen size. The price of this is $2.599. Some of Apples others designs such as the iMac G4, Power Mac
          G4 Cube, and Mac mini were also built around the G4 era. This era also had a massive inprovment of laptops and had better image and video quality. Volume was 
          also much better then before previous laptops. The only problem that occured during thie era was that Mototola couldn't produce the G4 CPUs in the amount og time 
          Apple needed and wanted it developed, it ended up having a slow speed to it making demanad for it to decrease.
