        <p><i>The PowerPc Era had the basic functions of a working computer</i>. It could switch from one mode to another, which is soemthing that the Powerbook computers couldn't
          do. The memory was replaced by an architecture called Book-E, which allowed past existing PowerPc implementations to have small changes in their opertaing systen.
          PowerPc is a microprocessor architecture that was developed by three companies including Apple, IBM, and Motorola. After these comapnies developed the PowerPC 
          to show the basic instructions of a computer, other companies started to use this for their computers, making PowerPc popular. Some design features include a simple
          processor design, 64-bit architecture, 8-bit bytes of memory, 32 general-purpose registers from GPRO to GPR31, and etc. Although this was a success, the PowerPc still 
          had its failures. Motorola chipsets were failing behind intels, causing bad quality an higher prices with these computers. The reason for this was because Intels chips 
          sold for 80% of the market while the company Apple's highest peak was at 12%. The reason why some say this was a failure is because there was an ongoing cycle that 
          just didn't have a solution for. Consumers wouldn't buy the products if developers don't bring their application there and developers won't bring their applications 
          if consumers don't want to buy it. The demand for high prices caused PowerPc to be a failure. Though it was still successful because Apple, IBM, and Motorola 
          inspired other companies like Microsoft Windows to use PowerPc. It was the start of producing a well developed computer and the start to better technology!
